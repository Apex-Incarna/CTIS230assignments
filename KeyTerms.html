<h2>Key Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concentration (in chemistry)</strong>--A measurement of how much of one substance has been dissolved into another.</li>
            <li><strong>Detergent</strong>--A compound derived from petroleum products, often used for cleaning. Detergents work by breaking up and surrounding dirt particles or oily substances, so that they can be washed away with water.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiber</strong>--Something whose shape resembles a thread or filament. (in nutrition) Components of many fibrous plant-based foods. These so-called non-digestible fibers tend to come from cellulose, lignin, and pectin — all plant constituents that resist breakdown by the body’s digestive enzymes.</li>
            <li><strong>Pascal</strong>--A unit of pressure in the metric system. It is named for Blaise Pascal, the 17th century French scientist and mathematician. He developed what became known as Pascal’s law of pressure. It holds that when a confined liquid is pressed, that pressure will be transmitted throughout the liquid in all directions, without any losses.</li>
            <li><strong>ArXiv</strong>--A website that posts research papers — often before they are formally published — in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. Anyone can read a posted paper at no charge.</li>
