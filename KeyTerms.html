        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concentration (in chemistry)</strong>--A measurement of how much of one substance has been
                dissolved
                into another.</li>
            <li><strong>Detergent</strong>--A compound derived from petroleum products, often used for cleaning.
                Detergents
                work by breaking up and surrounding dirt particles or oily substances, so that they can be washed away
                with
                water.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiber</strong>--Something whose shape resembles a thread or filament. (in nutrition) Components
                of
                many fibrous plant-based foods. These so-called non-digestible fibers tend to come from cellulose,
                lignin,
                and pectin — all plant constituents that resist breakdown by the body’s digestive enzymes.</li>
            <li><strong>Pascal</strong>--A unit of pressure in the metric system. It is named for Blaise Pascal, the
                17th
                century French scientist and mathematician. He developed what became known as Pascal’s law of pressure.
                It
                holds that when a confined liquid is pressed, that pressure will be transmitted throughout the liquid in
                all
                directions, without any losses.</li>
            <li><strong>ArXiv</strong>--A website that posts research papers — often before they are formally published
                — in
                the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and
                statistics. Anyone can read a posted paper at no charge.</li>
