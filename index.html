        <h2>Main Idea</h2>
        <p class="first">Using a polymer called guar, scientists can manage to make gargantuan bubbles.</p>
        <h2>Supporting Details</h2>
        <ol class="second">
            <li>The largest official free-floating bubble was about the size of a large classroom. However, that fact is
                nothing compared to what it was made of. The entire thing was made with little more than a cup of bubble
                solution. The sides of that bubble were a millionth of a meter! That’s <em>0.0004</em> of an inch!
            <li>The trick to making a great bubble is having a bubble that can stretch without ripping, the solution has
                to flow evenly throughout the bubble, and the whole thing has to stay together even as parts evaporate
                or gravity pulls it down.
            <li>Bubble blowing has been around for a long time. Surprising as it is, nobody’s actually studied the
                actual dimensions of a bubble or how it might work until now. Everyone kinda just threw stuff together
                and hoped they made a good bubble. Now, however, scientists have studied the actual makeup of these
                bubbles. A group in Atlanta, GA made devices that held a bubble in place, or nozzles that let a little
                of the solution out at a time. They sent infrared light (visible light wouldn’t work, it doesn’t get
                absorbed by the bubble; infrared light does) through the bubble and measured how much came through. They
                used that to see how much had been absorbed, and then used that to see the dimensions of the bubble. The
                nozzle they had pushing put tiny amounts of bubble solution. As the solution was pulled down by gravity,
                the farther it stretched, the farther it could stretch in a bubble.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Relationship to Science</h2>
        <p class="third">Bubbles might not seem very scientific, but they actually are. In fact, this study had to involve the fields
            of chemistry, gravity, and even polymers.</p>
        <h2>Summarizing Paragraph</h2>
        <div class="fourth">
            <p>Adding a polymer called guar (notorious for its ability to form long polymer chains in water, it’s also used
            in ice cream and pudding) to soap solutions gives the solution that perfect balance between stretch and
            strength. This was used to make the biggest free-flowing bubble in 2015. The properties of this bubble
            solution were tested for for its dimensions as well as its—for lack of a better word—stretchiness.</p>
