        <h2>Main Idea</h2>
        <p>Using a polymer called guar, scientists can manage to make gargantuan bubbles</p>
        <h2>Supporting Details</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>The largest official free-floating bubble was about the size of a large classroom. However, that fact is nothing compared to what it was made of. The entire thing was made with little more than a cup of bubble solution. The sides of that bubble were a millionth of a meter! That’s <em>0.0004</em> of an inch! 
            <li>The trick to making a great bubble is having a bubble that can stretch without ripping, the solution has to flow evenly throughout the bubble, and the whole thing has to stay together even as parts evaporate or gravity pulls it down.
            <li>Bubble blowing has been around for a long time. Surprising as it is, nobody’s actually studied the actual dimensions of a bubble or how it might work until now. Everyone kinda just threw stuff together and hoped they made a good bubble. Now, however, scientists have studied the actual makeup of these bubbles. A group in Atlanta, GA made devices that held a bubble in place, or nozzles that let a little of the solution out at a time. They sent infrared light (visible light wouldn’t work, it doesn’t get absorbed by the bubble; infrared light does) through the bubble and measured how much came through. They used that to see how much had been absorbed, and then used that to see the dimensions of the bubble. The nozzle they had pushing put tiny amounts of bubble solution. As the solution was pulled down by gravity, the farther it stretched, the farther it could stretch in a bubble.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Relationship to Science</h2>
        <p>Bubbles might not seem very scientific, but they actually are. In fact, this study had to involve the fields of chemistry, gravity, and even polymers.</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2> 
        <p>I don’t have many, but one that has got me thinking is whether an even bigger bubble could be made. With more solution, could an even bigger record-setting bubble be made? Also, could a smaller bubble be made with the same amount of solution? Would this bubble be harder to pop than the bigger counterpart? Easier? Could a bubble be made that is incredibly hard to pop, maybe made of ingredients other than a traditional bubble?</p>
        <h2>Summarizing Paragraph</h2>
        <p>Adding a polymer called guar (notorious for its ability to form long polymer chains in water, it’s also used in ice cream and pudding) to soap solutions gives the solution that perfect balance between stretch and strength. This was used to make the biggest free-flowing bubble in 2015. The properties of this bubble solution were tested for for its dimensions as well as its—for lack of a better word—stretchiness.</p>
