            <p class="first">I donâ€™t have many, but one that has got me thinking is whether an even bigger bubble could be made. With
                more solution, could an even bigger record-setting bubble be made?</p>
            <p class="second">Could a smaller bubble be made with the same amount of solution?</p>
            <p class="third">Would this bubble be harder to pop than the bigger counterpart? Easier?</p>
            <p class="fourth">Could a bubble be made that is incredibly hard to pop, maybe made of ingredients other than a traditional
                bubble?</p>
