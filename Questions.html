            solution, could an even bigger record-setting bubble be made? Also, could a smaller bubble be made with the
            same
            amount of solution? Would this bubble be harder to pop than the bigger counterpart? Easier? Could a bubble
            be
            made that is incredibly hard to pop, maybe made of ingredients other than a traditional bubble?
